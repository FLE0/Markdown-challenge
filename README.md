## A funny story
once upon a time... Ilias jumps in his dad's taxi and found a 50$ bill on the backseat we can say it was his lucky lucky day... or not.
Once back at home he was playing with small magnet in his parents room.
A pile of magnets in his hand, at war in his imagination.
 -GRENAADE
 *SUDDEN HAND GESTURE*
 BOOM
 The wardrobe door finished in a crumb
 The 50$ has been used for a new door (not even the good reference the wardrobe is still empty of door at this day)
### TL,DR
I'm still broke
